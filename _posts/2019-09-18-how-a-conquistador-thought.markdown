Recently I read [The Conquest of New Spain](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X6GJX5S/). It's a pretty unique book. It's written by this guy Bernal Díaz who was a soldier in the army that Cortes put together that captured Montezuma and sort of conquered the Aztec Empire.

The first thing about this book is just how old it is. It was written in the 1560s. That is before any European novels were written. What does that mean? I don't know.

You can read about how the Spanish invaded the Americas, and know a lot about it, but it has always felt distant to me. Here in California, cities and streets have Spanish names, plenty of people speak Spanish, but the conquistador thing still feels really distant.

There's something about reading a first-person account that makes it feel closer, makes you understand more of what they were feeling. Is it a good thing to understand more closely what the conquistadors were feeling? Well, I don't know. But I learned a lot.

To be fair, I'm not sure if I learned something about how the conquistadors thought in general. But I definitely learned a lot about how this one guy thought. Here are some things I learned, that surprised me.

### Díaz cared a lot about doing the right thing.

I think before I read this book my image of a conquistador was someone kind of like a criminal in a heist movie. Just someone who wouldn't discuss the morality of things, motivated by money, looking for a big score. Reading this book, Diaz talks *constantly* about doing the right thing, how to do what is ethically correct. His concept of the right thing just had near zero overlap with what you or I would consider to be the right thing to do.

XXX Kind of losing energy on this one. Need to finish later
