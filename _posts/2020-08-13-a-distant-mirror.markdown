[A Distant
Mirror](https://www.amazon.com/Distant-Mirror-Calamitous-14th-Century/dp/0345349571)
is an excellent book. It makes me want to read more history. It's hard
for me to "review" it, per se. It's not like eating dinner, where the
goal is for the dinner to taste good, and I can assess whether it
tastes good, compare to the best and worst dinners of my past, and sum
it up as four stars.

Instead it's more like the title of the book itself suggests. The
Middle Ages are a mirror, and we can look in that mirror to see
ourselves, to see our own era from a different angle. This book
provides the mirror, but if I learn something from reading the book,
does that tell me more about the Middle Ages, the mirror, or the
present day?

Such an alien time. The Black Death kills about a third of Europeans
from 1347-1351. Enormous debates about why it happened and what
should be done. Let's convene the greatest doctors and politicans of the
age. Everyone's analysis is just completely terrible. Maybe the plague
is caused by some theological error by the Pope. Maybe it's the fault
of the Jews. Maybe it's caused by Jupiter being in a certain
position. (That seems to have been the consensus of the French medical
establishment.) Maybe we're praying in the wrong way. Everyone
involved, every side of the debates, was just
completely wrong. Not even possessing the right mental framework to
find the answer. There are zero documents from the time mentioning
anything about rats or fleas in conjunction with the plague.

How could any intelligent observer of the time have been more correct?
It defies my imagination to think of any plausible way. In some sense
nihilism would have been more accurate than any of the prevailing
belief systems.

Besides the plague, the endless wars. I used to think of the Hundreds
Years' War as like, a big war that lasted a hundred years. Learning
more, it doesn't feel like that at all. It feels more like the Middle
Ages were just a mish-mash of constant little invasions and fighting here and
there. Before 1430 there was no standing army in France. Lots of small
armies of a few thousand people form up and disband for various
reasons. All the time some city is threatened by some army, they hire
a mercenary group or have a local put together an army, the threat
goes away, and the newly formed army just starts wandering around
extorting other cities. It might be my own inability to comprehend the
politics of the time, but it just seems like chaos. Later historians
sliced off one quasi-logical chunk of the chaos and called it the
Hundred Years' War.

The wars do not feel controlled. I know war always gets out of
control, but the fighting units of the time seem only somewhat
subordinate to the country they are fighting for. Armies get formed
and operated by some individual person. Maybe for a while they fight
for the King of France. But frequently there is a problem of, these
mercenary-ish armies got formed up to defend against something, but
now we don't have anything to pay them for, and the King cannot simply
order them disbanded. That isn't how it's done. The default is for
them to turn into criminal gangs wandering around demanding money from
the cities they pass by.

A nobleman owns territory in both England and France due to marriage,
and then England and France go to war. What should he do? Ah, the
perfect solution is to raise an army and go off and invade Italy. This
way he has a noble excuse for neutrality. Everyone seemed happy with
that solution, impressed by his chivalry.

The way wars are conducted also seems like everyone constantly
overestimates their knights. Fighting sieges without bringing siege
weapons, because the most important thing is the nobility of your
knights. The enemy is stuck in a position where your archers can
slaughter them all, but instead you keep the archers behind your
knights and have your knights charge, because that is the noblest form
of battle. The English destroy the French because their archers are
superior, but instead of prioritizing the development of archers as
the main military goal, the French don't seem to bother. Or they
bother, but do it poorly. Nothing like, hey let's pay a good salary
for good archers. No, instead let's ban non-archery sporting events for a
while, to encourage the peasants to practice their archery more.

A thousand years earlier, the Romans had half a million people in
their army. Trained, made up of common people, run by military experts rather
than aristocrats. All that mentality had become lost over time.

Religion, too. Was the Pope in Avignon or the Pope in Rome the true
channel to God? If you wanted to be forgiven for a terrible sin like
murder or blasphemy, which Pope did God want you to pay your
forgiveness money to? Clearly it was one or the other and the greatest
good would come if the world could just figure out which Pope was the
true one, so that you didn't have to pay off both of them just to be
sure of salvation.

What does all this tell me about the modern day? It makes me wonder, how
could someone looking back from the year 2650 think about our time and
think, it's funny how they had all these intense debates when both
sides of the debate were just totally wrong. Not even paying
attention to the most important dimensions. No ability to reach the
correct answer from the state of the discourse.

In the 1300's there are small, tiny hints at the uprising of
democracy. But they are crushed and would not rise again for
hundreds of years. Groups of people briefly saying, hey maybe we
shouldn't be ruled by a heriditary nobility, maybe we should
have... something else? They didn't have the time to figure things out
before getting slaughtered and put back in their places.

I am grateful to be living in the Pax Americana. I hope it lasts as
long as it can. One truth that holds constant throughout the ages of
history is that war has a terrible cost in human lives. I don't think
we are living at the end of history, and I don't think the Pax
Americana will last forever. Totalitarianism seems to be on the
retreat, but what if we have only seen the first, initial, malformed
examples of what it can do, like the doomed stirrings of democracy in the
Middle Ages? I don't really want to know what comes
next, what moral beliefs of our time will turn out to be quaint
fictions, what hopes of mine will forever prove impossible for
humanity.

So this hasn't been a book review, really, right? I can only
indirectly recommend this book, by showing a bit of how it has made me
reflect, what it has made me think about. I do recommend it,
though. [A Distant
Mirror](https://www.amazon.com/Distant-Mirror-Calamitous-14th-Century/dp/0345349571),
by Barbara Tuchman.

If nothing else, it has driven home how there are much worse things
than coronavirus.
