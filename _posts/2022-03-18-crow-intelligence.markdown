Consider this thought experiment. If you, with your current mind, were
suddenly trapped in a crow's body, would you ever be able to convince
any humans that you were intelligent? Maybe not.

Real crows, of course, have some huge disadvantages. They don't speak
English, they don't understand English, they don't have other crows
who can teach them how to communicate with humans.

When I was a kid, we learned in school that a key difference between
humans and other animals is that humans were intelligent enough to use
tools, and other animals could not. That lesson was slightly out of
date even in the 80's, as some examples of
[chimpanzees using tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFbqeVXzra0)
had already been discovered. In the age of cheap, portable cameras,
we've discovered a lot more.

## Crows

Personally, I'm interested in crows because there are a lot of crows
in the East Bay hills. They fly around my backyard, cawing at each
other, and I keep wondering if there's some underlying code to
it.

You can sink a lot of time into watching [videos of crows using
tools](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=crows+using+tools). They
can carve sticks into hooks, drop rocks into a pool to raise the water
level, and manipulate sticks in their beak in various ways.

How smart are crows, really? In AI we have the idea of a Turing test,
where something is human level intelligent if it seems just like a
human through a written channel. Crows can't pass a Turing test,
primarily because they can't even take a Turing test. They can't
communicate in a written channel in the first place.

I feel like it should be possible to demonstrate that crows are far
more intelligent than people thought, by teaching a crow to
perform... some sort of intelligent action. Like [Clever
Hans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans) doing arithmetic, but
not a scam. 

## Things That Aren't Crows

Are crows the right animal to try out intelligence-training? Wikipedia
has an [interesting
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons)
that claims that forebrain neuron count is the best current
predictor of animal intelligence and lists off animal species.

The most interesting thing about this list to me is that humans are
not the top of the list! Humans are pretty close, with 20 billion
forebrain neurons, but killer whales have twice as many, 40 billion
forebrain neurons.

What if killer whales are actually smarter than humans? We don't
really understand whale communication. [Project
CETI](https://www.projectceti.org/scientific-roadmap) is working on
it - to me, it seems like the key limiting factor is data
gathering. It's just incredibly time-consuming to collect whale
communication because you have to go boat around looking for
whales. No matter how fancy your AI techniques are, at the end of the
day if you have on the order of hundreds of communications, it seems
hard to extract data.

I think you really need some sort of interaction with the intelligent
creatures - children don't just quietly listen to adult speech and
suddenly understand it. They start talking themselves, you use simple
words communicating with them, you do things together while talking,
et cetera. All of that is just really hard to do with killer whales.

So most of the species with a similar number of forebrain neurons to humans are
aquatically inconvenient. Killer whale, pilot whale, another type of
pilot whale, dolphin, human, blue whale, more whales, more whales,
more whales, more dolphins, more whales, more whales. Then you have gorillas,
orangutans, chimpanzees, and another bunch of just extremely large
animals. The [Hyacinth
macaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw) might be more
promising. Only three billion forebrain neurons to a human's 20
billion, but at least they are small.

## Crows Again

Checking down this list, the smartest animal that actually lives near
me is the raven. Basically a big crow - I think crows are similar,
Wikipedia just lists ravens but not crows. Around a billion forebrain
neurons. Squirrels can get through some [complicated obstacle
courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg) and crows are
maybe 20 times smarter. I wonder if there's some sort of clever
obstacle course I could set up, have crows do it, and demonstrate they
are intelligent.

As I type this, the crows have started to caw outside my
window. I like to think they are expressing their support....
