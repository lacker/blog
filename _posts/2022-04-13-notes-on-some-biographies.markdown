It's spring break and I've been holed up in a New England farmhouse,
enjoying some "spring" afternoons, as it rains outside, the kids nap,
and I get to curl up and read.

My father-in-law is a history professor
and somehow I feel like the house has "ambiance of history". I feel
like reading history books while I'm there.

Recently I have been enjoying biographies. History books often feel
like a hundred different things are happening and my mind gets
shuffled up, forgetting precisely which ruler of which French city was
angry at the peasants because archery was so effective, and then it's
hard to be sure I have the correct meaning of a subsequent anecdote
instead of the backward meaning. With a biography, often the most
interesting things you learn are facts about the general time and
place, and the individual's life is just a nice structure to hang a
row of facts on.

These three biographies were particularly good and I recommend them.

## Euler

The book: [Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the
Enlightenment](https://www.amazon.com/Leonhard-Euler-Mathematical-Genius-Enlightenment/dp/0691119279). Euler
lived from 1707 to 1783, so technically this was before the
"industrial revolution" although his life shows so many ways that
science and engineering were making the world more effective that it
makes you wonder whether the industrial revolution was a concise
period or more a phenomenon that slowly arose over time.

When Euler was young, mathematicians were
ashamed to call themselves "mathematicians". The word had a
connotation of magic, numerology, and astrology. Instead he preferred
to be called a "geometer".

To understand Euler you have to understand Newton. Newton figured out
the basics of calculus and the basics of the modern laws of
physics. But he still did a lot of his work using geometry. Euler
basically destroyed geometry. He solved so many practical problems and
proved so many mathematical theorems using calculus, there was hardly
any role for geometry any more. Nowadays we learn geometry
because of its historical role in mathematics, not because any
practicing engineer is going to use even the most basic parts of
geometry like inscribing a circle in a triangle.

Mathematics was so low-status at the time. Euler's father wanted him to do
something useful, like become a priest. He won respect not by pure
mathematics, but by solving practical engineering problems like deciding what
shape of a sail would be the most effective, or determining the
longitude from observations of the moon.

Some people look nowadays and wonder, why is progress in pure
mathematics slowing down? Obviously Euler had a huge advantage,
studying mathematics when the competition was like, four or five main
academies in Europe had a few mathematicians each. But mathematics
wasn't a primary area of scholarly endeavor at the time. That would be something
like theology or the study of Greek literature.

Perhaps a field that gets little respect today will be looked back
on as the primary scientific achievement of our time. My bet is on
open source software. We are living in the era when Python, NumPy, and
Jupyter notebooks are first being invented! One difference is that
modern software is often developed by teams, as opposed to research
papers in the 1700s.

## Bismarck

The book: [Bismarck: A
Life](https://www.amazon.com/Bismarck-Life-Jonathan-Steinberg/dp/0199975396).

Bismarck is more like Steve Jobs than anyone else I've read
about. Intensely charismatic, except so many people disliked
him. Somehow when people talked to him they were charmed and convinced
by his unusual ideas. He ended up running a huge organization,
micromanaging everything in a way that infuriated many people and
exhausted himself, but at the same time achieving successes that were
thought impossible.

Bismarck is so full of contradictions. What did he even want? He was a
conservative, believing that a strong king should make all
decisions. And yet he clearly didn't want his king to actually make
decisions. It's a weird organizational setup in that the king could
technically fire Bismarck at any time, and yet once Bismarck as chancellor
had turned the King of Prussia into the Emperor of Germany, who was
going to fire him?

A monarchist who was the first in Germany to introduce universal male
suffrage, he clearly didn't like Jewish people personally but at the
same time he pushed through pretty strong religious freedom laws. He
somewhat randomly put together the first social-security-type
plan. But really his politics were all over the map. The only thing
that it really seemed he consistently believed in was that his
employer should gain more and more power.

In the end, it's hard to read about Bismarck without thinking of what
would happen a few decades later, in the system he built. The Kaiser
who finally fired a 75-year-old Bismarck would later get sucked into
World War I and lose the German Empire that Bismarck built for him.

It does make me respect George Washington and Steve Jobs more. If you make yourself
the first great leader of an organization, it can be impossible for
anyone else to keep it together. It's easy to take it for granted when John
Adams or Tim Cook keeps things going but that doesn't always happen.

Speaking of American presidents...

## Lincoln

The book: [Abe: Abraham Lincoln in His
Times](https://www.amazon.com/Abe-Abraham-Lincoln-His-Times/dp/159420604X).

Abraham Lincoln is like Jesus. So many people have written books about
him, there is far more commentary written after the fact than there is
direct evidence of any truth at the time. And the vast majority of
these writers think that the subject is a great, great human being, so
every anecdote, every little bit is slanted and has dozens of
accolades written about it. It's just impossible to read something
calm and neutral the way you can about, say, Euler, where nobody has
any real strong opinions about Euler and nobody has had any for a
hundred years.

So this book ends up asking questions like: was Abraham Lincoln
entirely honest throughout his entire life? And weirdly concluding
"yes" although in practice the book itself contains many
examples of Lincoln doing things like taking on pro bono cases for
clients he knew were guilty but were political allies of his, or
making statements that are clearly false. I mean, I would categorize
them as "normal politician" things. They aren't terrible. But it seems
like there is a faction which considers Lincoln to be more like an
angel than like a good politician, enough of a faction that this book
can both seem too rosy-tinted to me, and also declare itself to be
clearly on the "more negative on Lincoln" part of the
Lincoln-biography spectrum.

One of the striking things about Lincoln is how terrible so many other
politicians were. People were just drunk all the time. The
governor of Illinois, the vice president, and all sorts of lesser
characters make terrible missteps due to being plastered at important
events.

Politics in general seemed even dumber than today. Political cartoons
were often important drivers of public opinion, and they were even more
simplistic and "fake news" than modern campaign ads.

Lincoln does seem like a great president. He was more or less a normal
politician who did normal politician things, became president due to
a mix of luck and corruption, and found himself running the country in
a civil war that had already started, which gave him more power than
almost any other president. He then used this power to be
about as anti-slavery as he could possibly be - both the Emancipation
Proclamation and creating black army units were essentially "executive
orders" that he could do without Congressional approval.

I suspect that Sherman is underrated. If Lincoln didn't win the
Civil War, he would have been a bad president rather than arguably the
best one. And if Lincoln didn't get reelected he also wouldn't have
been able to get his full agenda through. Both of these seem in large
part due to Sherman's campaign being so successful ahead of the 1864
election. But this is only a sideline of the book - if I end up
reading more about the Civil War then I'm curious to learn more about
this aspect of it.

## Conclusion

Read one of these books! I feel like writing all this stuff about
books is worth it if even one reader decides to read a book as a result.
