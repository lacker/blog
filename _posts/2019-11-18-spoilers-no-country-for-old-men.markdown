I read a lot of books and I read a lot of stuff on the internet. Sometimes I wish there was
a better way to do these things together. There are communities online for so many things,
and there are a lot of book-reading communities too, but somehow none
of them work for me. Goodreads and various different subreddits are nice for finding new
books to read, but there's something that's missing.

Sometimes when I finish a book, I am left with a rich, complicated,
twisty set of thoughts in my head. I'm thinking to myself "That was a
powerful book. Excellent. Now..." and then nothing. I want to discuss
it with someone else who just finished reading the book at that very
moment. But statistically maybe that person just doesn't exist.

So, I will just write about it. What cripples this sort of
conversation on most online forums is that 99% of the people
interested in a particular book are people who are considering reading
it, but haven't read it yet. Probably 98% of those people won't end up
reading it. So the people with the most interesting thoughts on it
have to dance around what they want to say, especially if the book is
one where revealing secret information is a core part of the
experience.

From here on out, any post with "Spoilers" in the title is just going
to be chock-full of spoilers. Maybe this ruins the post for most of
the potential audience. I am writing this post for the tiny number of
people that has already read the book, *No Country for Old Men*, and
wants to explore their own thoughts about it. If you happen to be
willing to read about a book and accept that the plot will be spoiled,
be my guest.

One extra point - if I write about a book in these "Spoilers" posts,
that means I recommend that you read it. When I read a book I don't
like, I'm not going to bother writing about it.

On to the content.

## No Country for Old Men 

It is *gripping.* I made the mistake of starting this book a little bit
before bedtime last night. It hooked me and I stayed up a couple hours
later than I intended to reading it. The first 20 pages are intense.

I love the setting, of the Texas-Mexico border. Set in a time where a
few of the characters are Vietnam veterans. There is a feeling of
frontier emptiness. Like the characters are independent, free, simple,
not really clicked into a society.

I don't know if Cormac McCarthy uses a quotation mark in the whole book. The
dialogue is stuff like:

> What's that? said Wendell.
>
> Cylinder out of the lock.
>
> Bell passed his hand over the plywood of the room-divider. Here's
> where it hit at, he said. He balanced the piece of brass in his palm
> and looked toward the door. You could weigh this thing and measure
> the distance and the drop and calculate the speed.
>
> I expect you could.
>
> Pretty good speed.
>
> Yessir. Pretty good speed.
>
> They walked through the rooms. What do you think, Sheriff?
>
> I believe they've done lit a shuck.
>
> I do too.
>
> Kindly in a hurry about it, too.
>
> Yep.

There is a simplicity of form. He also seems pretty opposed to
adverbs. Does it relate to other simplicity? The simplicity of the
characters? Sometimes.

## Characters

There are three main characters. Moss, the guy who finds two million
dollars of drug cartel money, doesn't do a lot of internal
reflection. He doesn't turn the money over when the police ask him to,
and he doesn't seem to reflect on it much, either. It feels like he
just snap-decides.

Chigurh, the killer, we don't see his thoughts in the novel. But he
delivers psychopathic lectures before killing people. Flips a coin to
decide whether he'll kill them or not. Explains why, according to his
way of seeing the world, he has to kill someone.

Bell, the sheriff, we see plenty of his thoughts. Chunks of the book
are just him telling the reader about his life and thoughts.

I feel like simple sentences make some of the characters simpler. It's
easier to portray a quiet killer or a quiet cowboy type by just
leaving out most of the descriptive words. But Bell's thoughts touch
on life and death and ask questions that aren't simple to
answer. Apostrophes not required.

## The Drop

The real thing that makes this book a masterpiece is a huge twist near
the end of the book. It feels like Moss is the protagonist, running
from Chigurh. He's the good guy, respecting his wife, taking a few
risks, but generally smart and knows the land. You expect Moss to
eventually escape with the money and be the guy who turns the tables
on Chigurh. But no. The Mexican drug cartel simply kills
everyone. Chigurh kills Moss's wife, just to prove he's the sort of
guy that follows through when he threatens to kill someone's wife. The
drug cartel gets their money back. Bell can't manage to catch anyone,
can't handle being the sheriff any more, and retires.

The book doesn't even directly describe how Moss dies. For someone
that feels like a protagonist for the first three quarters of the
book, this is pretty crazy. I had to reread this section a few times
to understand what was going on.

There's three sections, separated by spaces that usually indicate a
change of perspective. First section: Moss goes to bed, bidding good
night to the hitchhiker he's traveling with. Second section:

> The Barracuda pulled into a truckstop outside of Balmorhea and drove
> into the bay of the adjoining carwash. The driver got out and shut
> the door and looked at it. There was blood and other matter streaked
> over the glass and over the sheetmetal and he walked out and got
> quarters from a change-machine and came back and put them in the
> slot and took down the wand from the rack and washed the car and
> rinsed it off and got back in and pulled out onto the highway going
> west.

This prose is really the opposite of David Foster Wallace. Instead of
complicated words in forking trees of logic, it's simple words that go
from one simple activity to another simple activity. But it still
creates a vivid picture. Terrible crime combined with everyday errands.

We haven't seen a Barracuda (some car from the 60s/70s) before in the
story. So all we know here is that someone is washing blood off their
car. Some new character killed somebody. And then, the next section is
Bell who stumbles across a new crime scene. He discovers that Moss was
killed. Killed by a couple of characters that are presumably other
employees of the drug cartel, who haven't appeared in the story before
this and don't appear in the story again.

If it was a six year old writing a story, this sort of plot resolution
would be unacceptable. But I can't argue that it's unfair. The irony
is that Bell has been warning the whole time that Moss is going to get
himself killed. And yet when it actually happened, I was taken by
surprise.

Finally, although the main issue of the drug money is resolved,
Chigurh hunts down Moss's wife and kills her.

## What does it mean?

Is it ridiculous how we expect novels to end happily? Maybe it weakens
your mind for reading about real history, or analyzing the real world.

Is this more realistic? Drug cartels are still around, so in some
sense they must be winning more battles than they are losing.

As the story ends, the only sympathetic thing remaining is Bell, reflecting on the
meaningless deaths around him. I don't often reflect on the presence
of meaningless death in the world. It does seem like there is a lot of
it, though. I have to give this novel credit.

When Moss took the money, I didn't think too much about it. That sort
of thing happens all the time in novels. By the end of the book, I
realized that was his key mistake. He just never should have gotten
involved. A chance at two million dollars wasn't worth risking his
decent life. And that's a pretty legitimate conclusion, isn't it? That
seems to map to the real world. How can a novel have a lesson of
"don't risk your life for X" unless someone dies for it?

Somehow, after all this grisly drug violence, the book still makes me
want to go out hiking through the Texas wasteland. But if I see a shot-out
truck with a dead body inside, I'll just call the cops. No need to
investigate myself, first. Lesson learned.
