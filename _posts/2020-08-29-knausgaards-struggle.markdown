I just finished reading [My
Struggle](https://www.amazon.com/My-Struggle-Karl-Ove-Knausgaard/dp/0374534144). Definitely
one of my favorite books of the past decade. Or perhaps I should say,
six of my favorite books of the past decade, since it's a six-book
series. I feel compelled to write about it, but I'm not quite sure
where to start.

First: what *is* this book? It is sort of an autobiography. Usually,
an autobiography is written by someone famous, someone who has some
sort of past achievement, and you are reading the autobiography to
learn about this achievement. Usually autobiographies are bad, because
the author is not a very good writer, they are famous for some other
sort of achievement. Knausgaard is a very good writer. And when he
started writing this, he wasn't famous for anything, or at least he
wasn't anywhere near as famous as he became for writing this
sort-of-autobiography. He is now famous, but pretty much because this
book is so good.

Back to the point of, it isn't one book, it is six books. Altogether
they are 3600 pages long. So it is very long either for a novel or for
an autobiography. Sometimes I think of it as "the book" because it
kind of works like one book. It constantly goes into far, far more detail than you would
intuitively expect. It reminds me of
[Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek)
creating one of the earliest microscopes, turning this new tool on a
boring drop of pond water, and revealing a world full of
crazy little monsters.

Knausgaard captures the mentality and
environment from his past, dives into the details, and exposes the
most embarassing, most real details. In a normal autobiographical
novel, these details would be hidden away. But exposing them is
precisely what Knausgaard is after. Hating and fearing his father
while growing up, the disgust he feels when his grandmother gets old,
the stupid things he did while chasing after girls when he was
younger, having trouble masturbating, cheating on his girlfriends and
wives, being cheated on himself, being depressed, his family members
being alcoholics, being frustrated
when his wife was depressed, being attracted to underage girls,
mistreating his children, just all sorts of things that it's hard to
believe a normal person would just tell you about himself. And yet at
the same time it doesn't come off like he's a bad person,
at all. He seems very understandable and relatable. It isn't really a
high percentage of bad behavior - it's more like every couple hundred
pages you're surprised he would admit to something.

To me these weren't the most interesting parts, either. They are the
parts that prove, in a sense, how honest he's being, and bring more
authenticity to the other parts. When he writes about struggling with
writer's block, struggling to write a great novel while spending huge
chunks of time dealing with mundane family and children issues,
struggling in his relationships with his extended family which are at
once critical to him and the source of so much pain, these
struggles in one sense are boring because nothing really happens, and
in another sense fascinating because he can describe in so many ways
how exactly he is feeling and how what at first seems like nothing
actually breaks down into dozens of little situations.

Each of the six books covers a different time in his life, not
entirely chronologically. One discusses his early childhood, one
discusses the time he spent married to his first wife, one
discusses the time around writing his first novel, one discusses the
time spent as a schoolteacher on an isolated island. I particularly
enjoyed the last book, which covers the time spent writing these books
themselves. After all the struggles to get past writers' block, the
idea for these books comes almost as a coincidence, and suddenly he
finds himself writing easily, writing ten pages a day when earlier in
his life he had trouble writing ten pages in a summer. After decades
of work, he finds overnight success. He starts to get famous, the
people in his life start to get angry that he wrote about them, and
finally the book ends at the very moment it is being written, with the
past catching up to the present.

One part I was fascinated by is his discussion of the Nazis. After
his father dies, he finds a Nazi pin in his belongings. After his
grandmother dies, he finds a copy of Mein Kampf in her belongings. And
that's it. He doesn't know anything else about it. How does he come to
terms with this? Is there something to come to terms with? The last
book in the series reels off into a literary-theoretical direction a
few times, detached from the main autobiographical thrust,
like Knausgaard has something else to come to terms with, and this is
one of them. It's like he is asking without answers, what does it
mean for an average person of the 1940's in Norway to have flirted
with Nazism? Like he can't quite bear to connect it with his own
family, even after so much personal exposure, and it's all just a
surge of thoughts and questions based on a couple pieces of
inconclusive evidence anyways, but he can't just let it drop without
exposing at least his own questioning.

Who should read this? I don't know. There's a lot of book here to
read. In the end, it is a story of a man struggling to combine his
intellectual career ambitions with his identity as a member of his
family. By the end of the book, it blends into reality. He succeeds
intellectually, in the success of these books, and his family life
recedes back out of the public eye.

I feel like I know Knausgaard so well after reading these books, we
have almost become friends. If you have the ability to read 3600
consecutive pages on one topic, the topic of Knausgaard's normal-ish
life, I think you will enjoy these books.
