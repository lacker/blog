Stephen Wolfram has a model of the universe, the
[Ruliad](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/),
in which every set of
possible rules for the laws of physics is operating in parallel. His
motivating hypothesis is the [Principle of Computational
Equivalence](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipleofComputationalEquivalence.html),
which states that no matter how a computer is
built, whether it be a regular computer like a Macbook or an implicit
computer running via cellular automaton, it is capable of computing
the same things.

Jorge Luis Borges wrote an excellent short story called [The Library
of
Babel](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf). It
describes an infinite library, containing all possible
410-page books. The vast majority are completely worthless nonsense,
but somewhere within its corridors, every possible coherent book
exists.

Perhaps these ideas can be combined. Consider the Datacenter of
Babel. Room after room is full of racks of computers. Every possible
codebase is running somewhere on one of its servers. Somewhere there
lies a Minecraft server where all the cows
are modded to look blue. Somewhere there lies a Bitcoin miner
containing Satoshi's private keys. Somewhere, perhaps, there lies a
computer slowly emulating a perfect model of our own universe.

Is the world a simulation? Is the Datacenter of Babel real? In some
sense, if the universe can be modeled by a computer at all, then the Datacenter of Babel *must*
be an accurate model of the universe.

Is this a useful model? Imagine strolling through the Datacenter of
Babel, connecting your laptop at random to various servers. The vast
majority, of course, are running nonsensical code, full of syntax
errors, crashing the very moment the machine was turned on. Without a
map, you could hike for years without ever encountering a functional
server.

Indeed, we have no real map to the space of all possible
programs. Wolfram theorizes that it should be possible to search the
space of short programs to find interesting ones. To me, it seems like
we can create a number of [neat-looking
pictures](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p54--more-cellular-automata/),
but we have never found anything useful by searching programs. Once
you realize that the Datacenter of Babel is not a useful model, you
also realize that the Ruliad is not a useful model.

The underlying problem with the Principle of Computational Equivalence
is ignoring the efficiency of programs. There
is a long history of this - the traditional theoretical definition of
"computable" functions ignores how long it takes to compute them - but
in practice, something that takes 10^100 time might as well be
impossible. The Datacenter of Babel might be a correct model, but it
is an inefficient model, in terms of how efficient it is to even
locate ourselves within the model, much less make any conclusion from
it.

I am entertained by the concept, though, of an infinite datacenter. I
wonder how one would set up the routers....
