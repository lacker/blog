Near the end of Proust's [In Search Of Lost
Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time), the main
character realizes that his own life can be the inspiration for a great
work of literature. During this epiphany, Proust makes a brief
digression to talk about art, and how to appreciate art you
really need to pay attention not only to the art itself, but also the
memories it triggers or the impression that it makes in you, the
viewer.

Let me quote a few sentences.

> Even where the joys of art are concerned, although we seek and value
> them for the sake of the impression that they give us, we contrive
> as quickly as possible to set aside, as being inexpressible,
> precisely that element in them which is the impression that we
> sought, and we concentrate instead upon that other ingredient in
> aesthetic emotion which allows us to savour its pleasure without
> penetrating its essence and lets us suppose that we are sharing it
> with other art-lovers, with whom we find it possible to converse
> just because, the personal root of our own impression having been
> suppressed, we are discussing with them a thing which is the same
> for them and for us. Even in those moments when we are the most
> disinterested spectators of nature, or of society or of love or of
> art itself, since every impression is double and the one half which
> is sheathed in the object is prolonged in ourselves by another half
> which we alone can know, we speedily find means to neglect this
> second half, which is the one on which we ought to concentrate, and
> to pay attention only to the first half which, as it is external and
> therefore cannot be intimately explored, will occasion us no
> fatigue. To try to perceive the little furrow which the sight of a
> hawthorn bush or of a church has traced in us is a task that we find
> too difficult. But we play a symphony over and over again, we go
> back repeatedly to see a church until - in that flight to get away
> from our own life (which we have not the courage to look at) which
> goes by the name of erudition - we know them, the symphony and the
> church, as well as and in the same fashion as the most knowledgeable
> connoisseur of music or archaeology. And how many art-lovers stop
> there, without extracting anything from their impression, so that
> they grow old useless and unsatisfied, like celibates of art!

The rest of the paragraph is pretty good, too.

Anyway, I used to think that when you looked at art you should use
some sort of "evaluating art" skill, the way I would look at the
design for a new database and think about whether it seemed like a
good database design or not. And it just seemed like I lacked this
skill, or found the development of this skill uninteresting. After
reading this book I was curious to try out this "Proustian" way to
appreciate art, where instead of wondering whether the art was good or
not, you just look at it and if it triggers any memories, you think
about those memories, see what things you can remember that you
haven't thought about in years, see if the art relates to those
memories and if you can dig in somehow.

So last weekend I took a trip to SFMOMA with my 9-year-old son, and I
really enjoyed this [exhibit of American abstract
art](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/approaching-american-abstraction/),
which I never really appreciated very much before.

[This piece](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/2000.204/) reminds me of
the blackboard in the first math class I took in college. The
professor would get really emotionally engaged in writing things on
the blackboard while talking about them, and in the process he would
seem to stop paying attention to the blackboard itself. Often it would
be impossible to distinguish different Greek letters, or different
parts of a formula would run into each other.

Rather than completely erase the board, the professor would sort of
quickly swipe an eraser and then start writing something else. The
blackboard became like the catacombs beneath Mexico City, new
buildings constructed on top of the ruins of past generations, with
the clever archaeologist able to discern layers of different lemmas
and corollaries.

It's like the subject itself, abstract algebra. Theorems about rings,
laid on top of theorems about fields, on top of integers, on top of
groups, all above a historical process of figuring this stuff out
that resembled the eventual outcome but shuffled around and with a
bunch of false starts mixed in there.

Meanwhile, my son enjoyed the sculptures that looked like the sort of
armor a bug monster would wear. The only flaw of the trip was the
cold and terrible pizza from the kid's menu at the cafe. Next time, I
will encourage him toward the chicken tenders.
