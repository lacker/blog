Sometimes the characters in a book are happy, excited, engaged in
their lives, having adventures, and when you read the book you get
fired up thinking about doing things like they're doing. And sometimes
a character is suffering. Some negative emotion is overwhelming them,
and the book isn't immediately viscerally pleasurable to read, but the
description is so vivid and rich you can't stop reading, you feel like
you are learning of the depths of human experience, although in some
sense the book makes you unhappy.

Recently, unintentionally, I have found myself reading several of this
second type of book. These books are very good, and I recommend you
read any of them that strike your fancy. They ring a bell in my head,
it sounds a beautiful note, but it is a negative feeling, a bad one,
and I don't to eject it per se, but I want to crystallize it and
set it aside to be known rather than felt. So I am encasing my
thoughts about these books in this blog post, to exorcise them, and
perhaps share them with you, o blog reader.

Let's begin.

## The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Other Stories

There are a number of different Tolstoy story collections; [this
collection](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Ilyich-Stories-Vintage-Classics-ebook/dp/B002VD6NJQ/)
is the one I read.

No surprise - the best story here is the title story, The Death of
Ivan Ilyich, and its emotion is the fear of death. There are so many
portrayals of death in modern culture, but almost always as a quick,
violent death, happening to somebody else. Ivan suffers slowly, with
doctors trying to help but achieving nothing. His family
members are both constantly near him, and not really close to
him, growing emotionally further away as he comes closer to death and
they remain alive. Is it possible to understand how you will feel when
close to death? Do we want to understand that?

Another great story in this collection is The Kreutzer Sonata. Its
emotion is jealousy. It's a real song, and it fits the story
perfectly. It's a sonata for violin and piano, played by two
people. The main character's wife plays this sonata with another man,
and the emotional bond it forms between them drives the main character
insane, sending him into a jealous, violent rage.

I think you should read this story and simultaneously listen to the
sonata. I lack the words to describe music well, but in the "presto"
part the violin and piano are handing the melody back and forth,
slowly building its intensity higher, and it just perfectly matches
the main character's rising insanity. Start it when you get to the
part where the main character starts talking about the Kreutzer
Sonata.

Try listening to [this
version](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Pd05vKoj2yspCnGc3PJrl) on
Spotify. Gidon Kremer and Martha Argerich are great musicians, but also, they have
become my mental image of the characters. Look at them:

Doesn't Martha Argerich look like she could be the beautiful woman around which
the love interests revolve in a Tolstoy story, and Gidon Kremer, with
that mildly goofy grin, look like he could be the sort of guy who at
first seems like an innocent nerd and then sneakily charms someone's
wife?

Anyway. Great stories.

Some critics, like Harold Bloom, think Hadji Murat, also in this collection,
is one of the greatest short stories of all time. I was surprised to
see that after I read it. My initial impression of the main character
(Hadji Murat) was that he is a naive and corrupt loser. He expects to
be able to convince the Russian empire to change its military
strategy, while being ignorant of its bureaucracy. He's bitter that he
has been fired by his side's leader. And what he wants is to be
installed as a local ruler, as the guy who betrays his own side in the
war. Indeed, he ends up failing to accomplish anything, dying
pointlessly, basically getting what he deserves. So, a decent story,
but nothing special. Reminds me of a bunch of real world stories from
Afghanistan.

But apparently many readers see Hadji Murat as a hero, a noble warrior
who represents bravery and ambition? I still liked the story as a
collection of vignettes about this eternal empire-vs-a-foreign-culture
war. I feel like there is this core assumption that it's noble to kill
a lot of people while achieving nothing because of the glory of war,
and people who like the Hadji Murat character must agree with that
assumption, and I don't. It's odd to me because War and Peace, which
Tolstoy wrote before writing this story, seemed like it was strongly
in opposition to that view.

## The Luminous Novel

[The Luminous
Novel](https://www.amazon.com/Luminous-Novel-Mario-Levrero-ebook/dp/B092HDKL16/)
is about procrastination. The author is a semi-famous
writer who gets a big grant to finish his masterpiece. He starts
recording a diary of everything he does, during his "year of finishing
the masterpiece". And it's just chock full of complete wastes of
time. Like, hex editing shareware to get around copy protection, when
he is "supposed" to be working.

Is it an interesting diary? It reminds me of
[Knausgaard](/books/2020/08/29/knausgaards-struggle.html) in some
ways - just much more realistic than you would expect, and that aspect
of it makes up for a lack of narrative or point. About halfway through
the book, I decided it was pointless, but somehow curious, and I
evaluated the book as "not that great" but figured I'd keep reading
anyway because, well, I was stuck in Tahoe and the I-80 was closed so
I was going to be reading *something* and I just wanted to great it.

And then maybe 85% of the way through the book, he's like, okay. So I
couldn't do it. I failed. Instead of my masterpiece, I have this
diary. I have a little bit of other stuff but it just didn't come
together. Then the last 15% of the book is what he has of the
masterpiece, and it's amazing. Gripping, realistic, vivid, each page
is everything you want of a great novel. It just doesn't fit
together. There's no real overall plot, no consistent set of
characters, only this dream of sharing this luminous feeling at the
heart of his life and love.

So did he do it? I feel like he successfully got 15% of the way
there. He died shortly after the period recorded, and this novel will
forever be a partially great novel.

The whole time he's waking up at 3 pm, going to sleep at 8
am, and trying a slew of weird herbal remedies. He mentions right at
the end of the book that he stopped drinking coffee and this seems to
have magically fixed his terrible sleep problems and made him
healthier in other ways too.

I found this book to be inspirational, honestly. He could have
produced a truly great novel. He succeeded at a lesser goal -
making a good, but fairly weird novel. I think the secret is a really
mundane one - he just should have wasted less time and improved his
health by taking the standard actions that everyone recommends to do
these things.

## Crime and Punishment

I finally succeeded in reading this book on my third
attempt. Sometimes a difficult book is like a difficult hiking trail -
if you're in shape, and you have the right gear, you can
enjoy a beautiful hike, when somebody out of shape wearing flip flops finds
it to be a painful slog. Perhaps recently I have been getting into
better "reading shape".

Most "antihero" characters have a fixed sort of badness, but they are
likeable, so you root for them as the story goes on, and they just
stay how they are. It's like the reader agrees to suspend their
disbelief and pretend the character is good, and just pay attention to
the exciting actions and hope they turn out well for the
antihero. Sometimes the antihero is only a little bad, like an art
thief who steals art and never hurts anyone, and you just permanently
accept that this sort of little bit of badness is okay. Or perhaps
they die in the end to achieve moral balance, so that you can be left
feeling that things worked out appropriately.

Raskolnikov is different. He commits murder, sort of because he needs
money, but also because he sort of has a philosophical view that he's
special and the regular rules of morality don't apply to him. His
thinking just isn't very clear at the time. And then it is impossible
for the reader to consistently root for Raskolnikov, because he
doesn't even consistently root for himself. His guilt becomes stronger
and stronger, eventually crushing him. He isn't like the crooks in a
heist movie who cleverly try to evade the law - he's distracted by his
own obsession about what he has done, slowly becoming less and less
able to even try to evade the police.

Which Raskolnikov is the more sympathetic one? The cool and calm
protagonist we see at the start who thinks he can get away with
murder, or the emotional wreck unable to face his family as he drags
himself to the police station to talk to the investigator, unsure
whether he should admit to the murder? Are we rooting for
Raskolnikov to get away with it, or are we rooting for him to do the
right thing, and confess?

## The Trial

The Metamorphosis is supposed to be Kafka's masterpiece, but I think I
liked this one better. (I read [this translation](https://www.amazon.com/Trial-Translation-Restored-Schocken-Library-ebook/dp/B00985E0VI).) The Trial is about that frustration and dread
you feel when interacting with a huge bureaucracy.

Of all these books, The Trial was the most painful to read. It's a
good thing it is relatively short. I would read a bit, pause, and just
feel miserable. Sometimes it was hard to say why I kept reading. But,
at the same time I strongly recommend this book.

There's a difference between how it feels in the moment to read a
book, and how it feels to have read a book. It's like a weekend afternoon
where the kids are causing all sorts of trouble, and it's so
frustrating, but for a fifteen minute period everyone is behaving so
nicely, and you snap a picture of mom and the kids baking muffins
where everyone looks so happy, and it's a great picture so you look
back at it later and have great memories, so you keep coming back to
the Good Muffin Recipe, and in the end a great tradition is formed.

Except, instead of eating delicious muffins, the payoff here is... a
deeper understanding of the emotional nature of being frustrated by
impersonal forces? Hmm. Well, it's a great payoff, trust me.

Josef K is arrested. He asks what he's being arrested for. Nobody
knows. It's not that they won't tell him - they're happy to tell him
what he's being arrested for. But that happens at a later stage in the
process. What is the process? Well, it's not as simple as just
explaining what the process is. The best way to handle it is to find a
good lawyer, or at least not one of the many lawyers who will mislead
you about the process more than they clarify. Of course, that isn't
straightforward. But good luck. Don't miss your first hearing. When is
the first hearing? Well, it isn't precisely a "hearing", it's more
like a discussion that gradually merges into a hearing.

And so on. It's like the nightmare where you forgot to turn in your
homework, plus the nightmare of being late to an important event, plus
the feeling of getting a notification from the IRS that you filed your
taxes wrong, all expanded out into a novel. There is nothing else
quite like it.

Kafka himself was essentially a middle manager in a large insurance
company. He was considered "tireless and ambitious". 

## Conclusion

This is enough. These books are great, but this is all the negative
novel I can handle, for now. Next I am going to try to read something
full of joy and delight.
