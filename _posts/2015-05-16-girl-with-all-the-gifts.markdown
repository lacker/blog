I'm torn about how to review fiction. I personally hate spoilers. And
[The Girl With All The
Gifts](http://www.amazon.com/The-Girl-With-All-Gifts/dp/0316334758)
is particularly nice if you have no idea what sort of book you're
reading. So if you're inclined to trust me and just buy a book and
read it without knowing what it's about, just do it. Amazon says it's
similar to [Wool](http://www.amazon.com/Wool-Hugh-Howey/dp/1491512644)
and [The
Martian](http://www.amazon.com/The-Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA)
so if you liked those, give this a try.

So, shallow spoiler alert begins here.

[The Girl With All The
Gifts](http://www.amazon.com/The-Girl-With-All-Gifts/dp/0316334758) is
a zombie book. I would say it is the second-best zombie book I have
read, after [World War
Z](http://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie/dp/0307346617). It
has a really fun beginning if you don't realize that it's a book about
zombies, but that's a hard experience to create if you're reading this
paragraph. Sorry. I had the perfect setup of buying this for my
Kindle, then forgetting about it for a month or so, then not
remembering what the book was but seeing it unread on my Kindle and
reading it. Magnificent! I recommend that methodology if you can swing
it.

It is not the sort of zombie book that is grisly and scary like an
action movie. Instead it is about a small girl who is a zombie but who
is also intelligent enough to understand her situation and to be cute
and threatening at the same time. The zombie apocalypse has never had
so much empathy for the zombies' side before.

There are a lot of parts of the book which are pretty
interesting, but they almost all are enhanced by surprising the reader
and I don't want to reveal too much. If what I've written so far
doesn't convince you to read the book, I don't see how
I'll be able to do it, so for the sake of spoilers I'll stop
here.
