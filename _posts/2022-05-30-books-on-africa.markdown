I've been reading various things related to Africa in one way or another
recently, I have three strong book recommendations on the topic, and I thought
I'd write a bit about them.

## [Dancing In The Glory Of Monsters](https://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Glory-Monsters-Collapse-Africa/dp/1610391071)

It's rare that I read a book and end up feeling that I liked the book, I
tried to pay close attention, and yet all the information flowed right
through my head and trying to hold onto it was like trying to catch a
river in my fingers.

There are just so many details. So many ethnic groups, so many rebel
groups, so many acronyms, so many refugee camps, so many cities where
an atrocity happened. And yet the overall picture steadily becomes a
bit clearer. Millions of people died in this series of wars in the
Congo. It's like a fractal story of chaos and loss.

The book is gripping. Like Game of Thrones, new characters enter,
fight for power, characters exit with gory violence and death. It's
hard to stop reading.

I have three takeaways from this book. One is simply that Westerners
underrate the amount of disaster and evil that has happened in central
Africa because it's so distant. Two is that many organizations in the
Congo have an intertwined mix of elections, war-violence, and making
money. In Western countries these things are much more separate.

The third takeaway is how impossible it is for NGOs to operate in the
Congo without themselves becoming intertwined in the status
quo. Paying taxes and fees in the Congo isn't like paying taxes and
fees in Denmark. Sometimes it is directly funding some local
warlord who is spending the money ramping up violence. The outcome of
spending money in war-torn regions of Africa is very non-obvious.

If you want even more of this sort of book, try [The War That Doesn't
Say Its
Name](https://www.amazon.com/War-That-Doesnt-Say-Name/dp/0691194084/). Similar
stuff, more academic, less un-put-downable.

## [Being Good In A World Of Need](https://www.amazon.com/Being-World-Uehiro-Practical-Ethics/dp/0192849972)

This book is aiming at the philosophical question of, should we donate
aid to Africa via NGOs? I found it to be a pretty compelling critique
of the Effective Altruism idea that it's possible to find a few
specific charities that are more effective than others, whether it be
malaria nets, deworming, or other causes.

The fundamental problem is that the GiveWell analysis of "this
charity saves one life for every $3000 you spend" is not
believable. They do a couple statistical studies that show malaria
nets saved lives in one case. But overall, aid to Africa doesn't
really seem to be lifting African countries out of poverty. We know
that many, many studies in social sciences don't replicate. Why should
we believe the small amount of research that suggests these particular
charities work over the research that shows the opposite?

GiveWell pretty much ignores the political side effects of funding
NGOs in Africa. Corrupt governments end up taking in a lot of money
through taxing and charging fees on NGO activities. These
organizations aren't just funding health care, they are also funding
violent dictatorships.

There is also a question of substitution. This isn't really in the
book, it's just something I've noticed after working with
nonprofits for a little while. Often there are donors who really want
their money to be spent with particular conditions. But the people
running the nonprofit have their own ideas of what's important. Often
you have a set of nonprofits that are essentially run by the same
group, and they raise money in different ways, but it all goes
essentially into the same budget. Your most restricted money, you
allocate that first. The money you have for the overall organization,
you allocate that last, for whatever areas you need to fill in the gaps.

In this world, donors simply don't get to choose where the marginal
dollar goes. Constraints on a funding source that's less than half
the budget just waste management time.
The whole idea of making a choice about the marginal
dollar is a construct designed to encourage people to donate. When
you're donating money to nonprofit causes, you should understand
that. Either fund a new organization, or let the leadership allocate
money. 

I worry that NGOs in a particular country essentially merge to become
the same nonprofit organization. They have to work together, right?
What sense does it make for multiple organizations to distribute
malaria nets to the same small town? But that means you can't really
have an influence on how they behave via donations. You have to trust
the overall group of cooperating NGOs to be doing the right thing.

So these two books together worry me that so much of the Against
Malaria Foundation work is basically [sending more resources into the Congo](https://www.againstmalaria.com/Distributions.aspx).

## [A Bend In The River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bend_in_the_River)

Different sort of book. Fiction! This book is a masterpiece.

Salim grows up in a coastal region of Africa, and the book follows his
attempts to run a business in central Africa. It's a different angle
toward a similar theme, to me, which is that so many different
cultures and interactions between the cultures happen within the
region that I often just lump as "Africa" in my mind.

Chaos, politics, love, violence, just like the nonfiction this book
left me feeling like I didn't necessarily understand anything any
better, but I started to realize how much I didn't know. The range of
emotions Salim feels is completely real but as if the author tapped
into a different set of emotions than you will read about elsewhere.

## Conclusion

If you are interested in the history of Africa, read the first
book. If you are interested in donating money to African causes, read
the second book. If you aren't interested in either of those things,
read the third book. Enjoy!
