I moved out to California in 2004, and quickly realized that the San
Francisco area had no seasons. "Winter" in January, it's 65 degrees
and occasionally rains a bit. "Summer" in July, it's 70 degrees and
never rains. That's it. In Cincinnati you get a larger range of
weather in a single day.

Now, unfortunately, we have a season. Fire season. It wasn't always
like this. A few years ago, maybe 2017, I went camping and woke up in
the morning and noticed our tents were speckled with ash. Since then,
every year there have been days where smoke covered the sky.

Growing up, school was canceled on snow days. Here, the kids have
smoke days.

Fire season isn't really in the traditional summer. It's a bit later, more like
September through October. Around here those months are drier and
perhaps hotter than June or July. The time formerly known as "fall". It's
appropriate to have a new name for this season, because the leaves mostly don't fall
off the trees here. 

Right now, it's a smoke day. Mid-eighties, and it's too smoky outside
to open the windows. My house, like a lot of houses around here, doesn't even have air
conditioning. The kids are all at home, because school is remote,
because of coronavirus, which also means we can't drive somewhere like
an office that does have air conditioning. So it's just everyone
hanging out in this hot sweaty box, staring at the smoky hellscape
outside. Waiting for the earth to fix itself.

At least the sunsets are beautiful. The smoke makes layers of glowing
orange and pink and the sun itself looks like a neon ball.
