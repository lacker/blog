It feels like a good time to start blogging again.

For a while I had a blog going on [lacker.info](http://lacker.info),
but unfortunately I was using some "Blogspot for your domain" product
that was deprecated over the subsequent decade.

This time, I'm betting that plain old HTML will be a format for the
ages.

I'm using Jekyll to generate that HTML because I liked it when we used
it for the original
Parse blog, although the [current Parse blog](http://blog.parse.com)
is just Wordpress. Also Jekyll is nice for `wordsLikeThis`.

{% highlight python %}
# Also it has nice built-in syntax highlighting.
def is_that_really_necessary(blogger):
  if blogger == "lacker":
    return True
  raise "TODO: implement logic here"
{% endhighlight %}
