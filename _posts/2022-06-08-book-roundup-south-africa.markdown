Often I get interested in a particular topic and I read a number of books
about that topic. After a while I feel like I have learned something from
a few different directions, I get sated, and I start to sort of sum things
up in my head.

So I'm trying something a little bit different book-wise. Whenever I have
finished a few different books on a topic that I like, I'm going to bunch
them together and write something about them. This is useful from my point
of view - when I've read several good things on a topic it's the time that
I want to reflect, and writing a blog post is a good way to reflect. I'm
not particularly convinced that it's good for you the reader to read
my comments on books in this way. But, we'll see.

I guess this isn't all that different - I've gathered book reviews
together before on the topics of [Africa](https://lacker.io/books/2022/05/30/books-on-africa.html), [biographies](https://lacker.io/books/2022/04/13/notes-on-some-biographies.html), and [mopey books](https://lacker.io/books/2022/01/28/books-of-one-beautiful-negative-note.html). Perhaps I should say, I like this
format and I'm sticking with it.

Today's book review topic is a narrowing of the last topic - not just Africa,
but specifically South Africa.

## [Life & Times Of Michael K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%26_Times_of_Michael_K)

This book is good in a literary sense. It isn't my favorite Coatzee - I liked
[Waiting For The Barbarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_the_Barbarians) better. The main character has this idea that sticks with me, that
he is sort of "dissolving into time" as he sits around doing nothing.

The South African regime seems Nazi-like or Stalinesque here. Prison camps,
work camps. I feel like still don't know very many core details about
South Africa despite all this reading. This book hits the emotional
angle but not really a factual one.

The way you can stake your whole life on basically nothing when you
have no other alternative... I don't have a verb phrase for this
sentence, but that thought, this book.

## [Born A Crime](https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood-ebook/dp/B01DHWACVY)

I rarely read the genre of book that is "popular autobiography of a
popular comedian" but the other day I was at a bookstore, picked
this one up to leaf through it, and just found it really
compelling. He was born to a mixed-race couple when that was illegal
in South Africa so his autobiography just gets off to a really
exciting start, dodging the law with a newborn.

I like it a lot. You sort of know how the story ends up - he becomes
successful in a weird career - although I actually haven't watched any
of The Daily Show since he started hosting. But it's really just
interesting for the stories of South Africa from an unusual racial
background.

I didn't realize just how many racial groups were fairly prominent in
South Africa. Xhosa, Zulu, maybe a dozen others. It gives me this
feeling of a whole world that I have only barely scraped the surface of.

## [Triomf](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RS16G4Z/)

This book is a bit of a crazy one. It was unexpected to me how this
and the Michael K book are from the point of view of white citizens of
South Africa, and yet the main characters are completely and utterly
miserable, suffering with a terrible life, like if these had been in
countries where they were racistly kept down it would make total
sense, but these aren't even the people bearing the brunt of the South
African regime!

In the US these characters would be "white trash". In South Africa
there is probably some analogous pejorative, I just don't know it.

The characters are just so, so lost. So far from any happy life
outcome. I just can't imagine an alternative storyline where they end
up succeeding. And yet are they really unhappy? I don't know.

## Conclusion

It's funny I'm reading all these books about South Africa as I road
trip around the Pacific Northwest. Often I like to read books about a
place as I travel through the place. This is more like doing the
opposite.

I must have learned about South Africa in reading these books. But
emotionally I feel like my level of understanding of South Africa is
lower than it was before. It's one of those cases where every question
you answer, you learn about three more questions that you don't know
the answer to.

My best book recommendation from these is honestly not even one of the
ones listed, it's that I'm reminded of Waiting For The Barbarians
which I liked better than any of these. So go read that one. It is
kind of about South Africa, too, although it nominally isn't, and I
didn't realize it when I first read it.
