I was born in Los Angeles in 1980, first child of a librarian and a
pediatrician. A couple years later, we moved to Cincinnati, where I
would spend the rest of my childhood.

As a kid in the Midwest I was proud of being born in California,
although I didn't remember anything about it. It just made me feel
special.

When I was growing up I read a lot of books. I still read a lot of books.
